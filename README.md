# Weather App

A simple weather application built with React that displays:

- **Current weather data** (temperature, condition, etc.)
- **Today's air quality** information (e.g. PM2.5, CO, NO2, etc.)
- **24-hour hourly forecast** data

The data are powered by the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/), which provides reliable and up-to-date weather information via their API.
